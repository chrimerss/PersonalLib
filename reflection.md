The essence of research lies in the people who carry it out. Breakthroughs in research do not come from instrumentation, computers, and satellites; they grow in the minds of individual men and women.

…. inspired guesses are not enough. Progress comes primarily from the introduction of new observational and theoretical tools.

Authors again emphysized the underpinning importance of co-evolving modeling of water-human instead of one-way feedback.

"The future of hydrology is closely related to improving our understanding of changing behaviours of hydrological systems through the study of their two-way interaction with connected processes (Baresel and Destouni 2005, 2007, Wagener et al. 2010, Schaefli et al. 2011)."

"While exploitation is relatively straightforward to estimate, the feedbacks—such as those triggered by reservoir impacts, or those considered in flood risk analysis, by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013a)—the climatic changes, the degradation of water bodies and many others, are poorly understood."

__[Where should hydrology go? An early-career perspective on the next IAHS Scientific Decade: 2023-2032](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02626667.2023.2170754?src=)__

Three main themes are discussed among Early Career Scientists in Europe regarding next decadal focal point of Hydrology:

1. The tipping point of hydrologic science

This involves three questions: How can hydrological tipping points and thresholds be identified?

At what scales are the identified tipping points and thresholds relevant and how do these scales interact?

Which non-hydrological tipping points affect hydrological systems?

What needs to be included in hydrological models to simulate and predict tipping points and thresholds? How reliable are modelled tipping points and thresholds?

How can we use our knowledge of tipping points and complex systems to mitigate the impacts of environmental and climate change?

2. Intensification of water cycle

What is the impact of an intensified hydrological cycle on the environment, ecosystem services and society?

What areas are most at risk of the intensification of the hydrological cycle?

How reliable are extreme event predictions that are based on extrapolating relatively short data series and how can this reliability be improved?

How can early-warning systems be improved so that extreme events can be accurately predicted?

Which mitigation strategies are suitable in the context of ongoing intensification of the hydrological cycle?

3. Water services under pressure

How can we assess quantitative and qualitative water availability for sustainable water services?

What hydrological knowledge is missing to provide solutions to support water services?

How can the development of pressures on water services be identified, monitored and predicted?

What are the scales and spatiotemporal distributions of pressures on water services?

__[Barriers to progress in distributed hydrological modelling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.10434)__

Authors mention the main barriers to hydrological modeling, which is that no one seems to care about whether the model is capable of representing a wide-range of hydrological processes, and instead, they often assume that models can be justified through calibration.

Another barrier is data which hinders model validation.
