The essence of research lies in the people who carry it out. Breakthroughs in research do not come from instrumentation, computers, and satellites; they grow in the minds of individual men and women.

…. inspired guesses are not enough. Progress comes primarily from the introduction of new observational and theoretical tools.

|Era|Societal needs|Technological opportunities|Euphoria|Typical discoveries of phenomena|Progress in prediction methods|Disenchantment|
|---|--------------|---------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|
|1910–1930 Empirical Era|	Flood design|	National instrumented networks|	Predictability, clear benefit for technical progress|	Correlations between water levels exist|	Regressions, envelope curves|	Lack of transferablity to other places|
|1950–1970 Systems Era|	Economic efficiency|	Operations Research, first digital applications|	Objectivization by Systems Approach (to overcome subjectivity)|	Linearity of hydrological response|	Unit hydrograph estimation, time series models|	Inability to extrapolate to other conditions|
|1970–1990 Process Era|	Water quality (chemical)|	Fast computers, new data collection methods|	Solve hydrology as a physical problem (to overcome inability to extrapolate)|	Variable source area runoff generation; Event water stems from pre-event rainfall|	Physically-based spatially distributed models, stochastic hydrogeology|	Scale problems, it is not just a physical but also a biological problem (transpiration, roots)|
|1990–2010 Geosciences Era|	Climate change, ecosystem health|	Remote sensing, internet|	Interdisciplinarity allows more accurate representation of complex processes|	Controls on spatial patterns of soil moisture	|Coupled process models, model chains, climate scenarios, data assimilation|	Quasi-stationary coupling misses long term dynamics|
|2010–2030 Coevolution Era|Sustainable development given dominant human footprint|	Big data, faster computers, finer resolution remote sensing|	Including feedbacks explicitly promises predictability over decades/centuries|	Root adaptation to climate, levee effect of people moving into floodplains|	Models representing catchments as complex systems (linking time scales)|	Parameters of complex systems cannot be measured, spatial feedbacks missed|
