The essence of research lies in the people who carry it out. Breakthroughs in research do not come from instrumentation, computers, and satellites; they grow in the minds of individual men and women.

…. inspired guesses are not enough. Progress comes primarily from the introduction of new observational and theoretical tools.

|Era|Societal needs|Technological opportunities|Euphoria|Typical discoveries of phenomena|Progress in prediction methods|Disenchantment|
|---|--------------|---------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|
|1910–1930 Empirical Era|	Flood design|	National instrumented networks|	Predictability, clear benefit for technical progress|	Correlations between water levels exist|	Regressions, envelope curves|	Lack of transferablity to other places|
|1950–1970 Systems Era|	Economic efficiency|	Operations Research, first digital applications|	Objectivization by Systems Approach (to overcome subjectivity)|	Linearity of hydrological response|	Unit hydrograph estimation, time series models|	Inability to extrapolate to other conditions|
|1970–1990 Process Era|	Water quality (chemical)|	Fast computers, new data collection methods|	Solve hydrology as a physical problem (to overcome inability to extrapolate)|	Variable source area runoff generation; Event water stems from pre-event rainfall|	Physically-based spatially distributed models, stochastic hydrogeology|	Scale problems, it is not just a physical but also a biological problem (transpiration, roots)|
|1990–2010 Geosciences Era|	Climate change, ecosystem health|	Remote sensing, internet|	Interdisciplinarity allows more accurate representation of complex processes|	Controls on spatial patterns of soil moisture	|Coupled process models, model chains, climate scenarios, data assimilation|	Quasi-stationary coupling misses long term dynamics|
|2010–2030 Coevolution Era|Sustainable development given dominant human footprint|	Big data, faster computers, finer resolution remote sensing|	Including feedbacks explicitly promises predictability over decades/centuries|	Root adaptation to climate, levee effect of people moving into floodplains|	Models representing catchments as complex systems (linking time scales)|	Parameters of complex systems cannot be measured, spatial feedbacks missed|

Authors again emphysized the underpinning importance of co-evolving modeling of water-human instead of one-way feedback.

"The future of hydrology is closely related to improving our understanding of changing behaviours of hydrological systems through the study of their two-way interaction with connected processes (Baresel and Destouni 2005, 2007, Wagener et al. 2010, Schaefli et al. 2011)."

"While exploitation is relatively straightforward to estimate, the feedbacks—such as those triggered by reservoir impacts, or those considered in flood risk analysis, by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013a)—the climatic changes, the degradation of water bodies and many others, are poorly understood."
