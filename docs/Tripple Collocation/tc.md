ETC is performed in this study to fomularize correlation coefficient, and also decomposed errors into independent products to investigate the error caused by each pair. The author
also demonstrated that MTC is more appropriate in rainfall uncertainty estimation.

It compared multiple satellite products from SM2RAIN, and illustrated it can facilitate TC method as an additional source. It further extends TC to a global scale.

The author evaluated the performance of multiple satellites and global gauge products, validated TC method in southern region of China to prove the applicability. And eventually they applied TC in gauge-free regions e.g. Tibet to show which product is more reliable.

The author validated the appropriateness of MTC to ATC in rainfall error estimation, and transformed logarithmic error back to linear domain by Tayler expansion.

The author described using TC derived RMSE to update Kalman filter.
