__Kirschbaum, D. and T. Stanley (2018). "Satellite-Based Assessment of Rainfall-Triggered Landslide Hazard for Situational Awareness." Earth's Future 6(3): 505-523.__

The author used IMERG NRT and TRMM NRT satellite QPE to feed into landslide model to triger forecast. It has been found that
 IMERG NRT QPE tends to be improved in detection landslide than TRMM.
