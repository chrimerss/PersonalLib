[Spatial and temporal variation of extreme precipitation over the Yangtze River Basin](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2007.09.001) 

1. Extreme precipitation analysis in Yangtze River in China
  a. Long-term trend is detected from non-parametric Sean's method
  b. REOF (rotated EOF) is used to find both spatial and temporal variability
  c. wavelet transform to decompose time series into time-frequency space to discover the periodicity;
  
2. Extreme events is defined as daily precipitation exceeding 95th percentile

[ENSO and Wintertime Extreme Precipitation Events over the Continuous US](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2007JCLI1705.1)

1. EOFs are used to analyze daily precipitation fields with compositing 500-mb heights
2. study domain CONUS but special focues on coastal regions
3. From PCs to infer large flood events;
4. Inspect how ENSO impact extreme precipitation (Gumbel PDF)

[Comparison of the GPCP and CMAP Merged Gauge–Satellite Monthly Precipitation Products for the Period 1979–2001](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JHM-392.1)

1. Normalized precipitation (remove climatological mean and divided by standard deviation)
2. EOF analysis: common EOF (cEOF) to study the common spatial patterns in the GPCP and CMAP. To perform this, GPCP and CMAP are concatenated along time dimension and then separated.
3. An interesting plot with x the month and y axis the year. In between is the spatial correlation
    Due to the variability nature of precipitation, the EOF modes only explain little amount of variations.
