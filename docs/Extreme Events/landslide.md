The author used IMERG NRT and TRMM NRT satellite QPE to feed into landslide model to triger forecast. It has been found that
 IMERG NRT QPE tends to be improved in detection landslide than TRMM.

In this paper, a framework predicting landslides is proposed, taking hydrostatic variables (i.e., soil type, DEM, surface, and etc.) and
dynamic variables (i.e., precipitation with TMPA). Specifically, precipitation intensity-duration curve is constructed both reginally and worldwide
 to support decision-making.
