# Flash Flood Index

__Zeng, Z., et al. (2016). "A cascading flash flood guidance system: development and application in Yunnan Province, China." Natural Hazards 84(3): 2071-2093.__

In this paper, the author proposed a framework which integrates data from precipitation, DEM, GPD etc. With these information, they take advantage of information entropy approach to assign different weights to each category. After that, they came up with an index map covering Yunnan province in China to assess the susceptibility of flash flood.

__Ombadi, M., et al. (2018). "Developing Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves from Satellite-based Precipitation: Methodology and Evaluation" Water Resources Research__

In this paper, the author tried to develop IDF curve through 3 steps: 1. bias adjustment, 2. Point-to-Area transformation, 3. develop IDF curve with IR satellite data PERSIANN-CDR. The results are compared with NOAA Atlas 14.

The adjustment of bias is related to altitude because the author found the bias is increasing with elevation for IR satellite precipitation products.
