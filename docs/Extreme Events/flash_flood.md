# Flash Flood Index

__Zeng, Z., et al. (2016). "A cascading flash flood guidance system: development and application in Yunnan Province, China." Natural Hazards 84(3): 2071-2093.__

In this paper, the author proposed a framework which integrates data from precipitation, DEM, GPD etc. With these information, they take advantage of information entropy approach to assign different weights to each category. After that, they came up with an index map covering Yunnan province in China to assess the susceptibility of flash flood.
