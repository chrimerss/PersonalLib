# Harzard, Exposure, and vulnerability
[__Inequitable patterns of US flood risk in the Anthropocene NCC__](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01265-6.)

__[Flood exposure and poverty in 188 countries Nat Comm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30727-4)__

THe authors use a global 30 meter hydraulic simulation to project future 1-in-100-year flood events, overlaid with population data and socioeconomic profiles.

__[Too much and not enough Nat Sustainability](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00766-8)__
We have too much intensity-based studies while not having enough impact-based studies, including the impact of hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that are closely tied to people's living conditions.

__[Large and inequitable flood risks in Los Angeles, California Nat. Sustain.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00977-7)__

This article, the authors produced 3-m flood map based on 1-in-100-year flood events. They mapped the inundated area with social economic indicators such as vulnerabilities and exposures, represented in a composite indicator: Gini coefficient. It was found that flood risks are disproportionately higher for non-Hispanic Black and disadvantaged populations.

Scenario-based exploration of how climate change and floodplain restoration could contribute/reduce flood risks for community.

# Incorporating indigenous knowledge

__[Exploring the integration of local and scientific knowledge in early warning systems for disaster risk reduction: a review](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11069-022-05468-8?sharing_token=GLlBp6dbdpL7Vjs6fuB-Lfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7RsoLXhjzfsUSvPd7GIkYCozLZN4Q8uR_zKb-_anrE8kANNw79S5mIHb7Z2KmXjD_gTS4aBzdVT5YjF1tt92lOnVpCnr5nsj20JvFNz6-wh58p1fEXPHQ5AcMOskleNvA%3D)__

"The monitoring and forecasting component of the EWS has to go from giving a warning about what the weather will be to a warning about what the weather will do. The World Meteorological Organization calls this impact-based forecasting (IBF), developing a forecast of the potential consequences of a climate hazard event in terms of its effects on people, infrastructure, etc."

# Actionable knowledge
__[Actionable knowledge and the art of engagement](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877343520300026)__

This is a review article about what is actionable knowledge and how to produce actionable knowledge.
