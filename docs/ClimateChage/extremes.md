__[Increasing sequential tropical cyclone hazards along the US East and Gulf coasts NCC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01595-7#ethics)__

The authors investigated the probability of sequential landfalling hurricanes using historical observations and future climate simulation. It is found that A Katrina-like TC and a Harvey-like TC impacting the United States within 15 days of each other, which is non-existent in the control simulation for over 1,000 years, is projected to have an annual occurrence probability of more than 1% by the end of the century under the high emission scenario.
