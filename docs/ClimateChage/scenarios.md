__[Catastrophic climate risk should neither be understated nor overstated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2214347119)__

This letter argues that most studies focus on implausible climate change scenario in SSP - SSP585, SSP-370, yet a more plausible scenario - SSP245 (confidence 5-95% for temperature rise in 2.1-3.5 C in 2100) has been ignored in catastrophic climate risk studies.


__[Climate model projections from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) of CMIP6](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/12/253/2021/)__

This is a description paper of designing ScenarioMIPs and their inter-scenario patterns of global temperature and precipitation.

__[Future global streamflow declines are probably more severe than previously estimated Nat Water](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-023-00030-7#peer-review)__

In this article, the authors used historical gauges to infer streamflow elasticity around the globe. They found CMIP6 model output may provide an optimistic picture of streamflow predictions while the reconstruction of historical flow shows more severe declines.
