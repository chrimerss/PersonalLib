__[Catastrophic climate risk should neither be understated nor overstated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2214347119)__

This letter argues that most studies focus on implausible climate change scenario in SSP - SSP585, SSP-370, yet a more plausible scenario - SSP245 (confidence 5-95% for temperature rise in 2.1-3.5 C in 2100) has been ignored in catastrophic climate risk studies.
