# Indirect flood damage assessment

Direct flood cost is tangible cost, such as building submerged, fatalities, or cars.

Indirect cost, on the other hand, is invisible, such as wages, impairment of supply chain network, etc.

__[The macroeconomic impacts of future river flooding in Europe ERL](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab3306)__

The authors claim that the indirect cost during flooding could be as twice as direct cost.

This study presents a comprehensive flood risk analysis that explicitly includes regional economic interdependencies on a continental scale. They also analyzed the impacts of floods under climate change.

__Indirect impacts are calculated by using a recursive dynamic multiregional supply and use model: the multi regional impact assessment (MRIA) model__

For the direct damages, they used the depth-damage curve.
