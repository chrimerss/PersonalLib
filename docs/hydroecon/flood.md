# Flood and economics

__[Heidi Kreibich](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=UH26sowAAAAJ)__ 

Estimating flood damages

__[The wider the gap between rich and poor the higher the flood mortality Nat. Sustainability](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01107-7)__

"When there is rain or snow, you can make more money"

The authors looked into economic inequalities like the Gini index associated with flood mortalities.

# Flood damage curve

__[Establishment of flood damage function models: A case study in the Bago River Basin, Myanmar](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S2212420918301122?via%3Dihub)__

The author collected questionnaire surveys and constructed a relationship between flood damage and water height.

__[Economic motivation for raising coastal flood defenses in Europe Nat. Communication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15665-3)__

__[Modelling the behaviour of corporations during the flood damage recovery process using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfr3.12845)__

They used flood inundation modeling results overlaid with corporate behaviors during flooding and optimized their strategy using multi-agent modeling.

Some renowned researchers in this field:

__[David Mendoza Tinoco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g49DLJkAAAAJ&hl=es)__ who invented this concept


# Indirect flood damage assessment

Direct flood cost is tangible cost, such as building submerged, fatalities, or cars.

Indirect cost, on the other hand, is invisible, such as wages, impairment of supply chain network, etc.

__[Flood Footprint Assessment: A Multiregional Case of 2009 Central European Floods](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206191008id_/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/risa.13497#:~:text=The%20flood%20footprint%20is%20an%20impact%20accounting,assess%20the%20physical%20damage%20(direct)%20and%20production)__

A literature review of flood footprint analysis including economic models used for disaster damage assessment.

__[The macroeconomic impacts of future river flooding in Europe ERL](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab3306)__

The authors claim that the indirect cost during flooding could be as twice as direct cost.

This study presents a comprehensive flood risk analysis that explicitly includes regional economic interdependencies on a continental scale. They also analyzed the impacts of floods under climate change.

__Indirect impacts are calculated by using a recursive dynamic multiregional supply and use model: the multi regional impact assessment (MRIA) model__

For the direct damages, they used the depth-damage curve.
