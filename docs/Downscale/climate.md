__[Climate Change Impact Studies: Should We Bias Correct Climate Model Outputs or Post-Process Impact Model Outputs?](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020WR028638)__

The authors compared both pre-modeling bias correction & downscaling and post-modeling bias correction & downscaling to analyze its effectiveness in hydrologic impact-based studies. They found that post-modeling bias correction (bias correcting streamflow) is slightly more effective than bias-correcting precipitation et al.
