__Ma, Z., et al. (2019). "An updated moving window algorithm for hourly-scale satellite precipitation downscaling:
a case study in the Southeast Coast of China." Journal of Hydrology.__

Author synthesized IMERG data and coupled with cloud properties e.g. cloud   effective   radius   (CER),
cloud   top   height   (CTH),   cloud   top temperature (CTT) and cloud optical thickness (COT) to perform hourly based satellite QPE
downscale. 

According to the result, CER is the one that affects downscale performances most.
