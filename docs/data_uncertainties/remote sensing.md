Author compared satellite data from PERSIANN-CCS, and NCEP stage IV radar data as reference from temperal, and spatial scale. From the analysis, satellite errors (RMSE) is mitigated as aggreated space and time, but the percentage of error (normalized) indicated that satellite tends to have larger relative error in lower range of rainfall intensity. What's more, author evaluated the error propogation by a hydrologic simulation, and offered an uncertainty estimation.

The author evaluated IMERG PrecipUncal and PrecipCal, found that calibrated precipitation improved the accuracy dramatically, while both Uncal and Cal suffer from light precipitation and winter, overestimating in these range in China.

Author compared IMERG final product with TMPA-3B42 and ECMWF, found that Overall, in daily scale the results reveal that all three products lead to underestimation but IMERG performs better than other products and underestimates precipitation slightly in all four regions. Good results were obtained with rainfall amounts greater than 15 mm/day during rainy periods or in humid regions. 

__Prakash, S., et al. (2016). "From TRMM to GPM: How well can heavy rainfall be detected from space?" Advances in Water Resources 88: 1-7.__

Author showed an improvement if IMERG data compared to TMPA data in detecting extreme rainfall events in India. Even though the TMPA data showed a larger probability of detection of heavy rainfall events most parts of the country, it showed a large false alarm ratio and a relatively small critical success index.

In this paper, authors utilized 75 percentile as a threshold to diffentiate heavy or normal events, and computed POD, FAR, CSI based on that criterion.

Author intercompared different products but all derived from TRMM, 3B42, 3B42RT, CMORPH, GSMaP, PERSIANN, NRL. The uncertainties are relatively small (40–60%) over the oceans, especially in the tropics, and over southern South America. There are large uncertainties (100–140%) over high latitudes (poleward of 40° latitude), especially during the cold season.

Author analyzed three composite products derived from TRMM, and used climatological statistics to estimate the uncertainties.

1. IMERG underestimates at high rain intensity, and overestimates at low rain intensity.  
2. IMERG-L only provides marginal benefits for IMERG-E.  
3. IMERG-F outperforms than early and late products.
