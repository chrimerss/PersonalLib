# Gauge Measurement Errors

[__The impact of tipping-bucket raingauge measurementerrors on design rainfall for urban-scale applications__](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/hyp.5646)

limited influence on rain-intensityfigures, but areimportant for rain accumulation
measurements at the daily, monthly or longer time scales. These are commonlycategorized as
wind-induced, wetting, splashing, and evaporation errors, all of them occurring within or
atthe top of the water collector implemented to convey rainfall from a standardized orifice
into the measuring device.

On the other hand, mechanical errors due to the inherent characteristics of the counting
device, althoughless important in terms of accumulated rainfall, have a strong influence on
the measurement of the rainintensity, with an increasing impact as the rain rate increases.
In particular, the measurement of rain intensityis traditionally performed by means of
tipping-bucket rain gauges, the most popular and widespread typeof rain gauge actually employed
worldwide. This is known to underestimate rainfall at higher intensitiesbecause of the rainwater
amount that is lost during the tipping movement of the bucket.

The bias, estimated on average at about 10â€“15% for rain rates higher than 200 mm $h^{-1}$,
is strongly specificto the single rain gauge, depending on the manufacturer, the date of
production and the type of wear

The bias induced by systematic mechanical errors of tipping-bucket rain gauges is usually
neglected inhydrological practice, based on the assumption that it has little influence on
the total recorded rainfall depth.We have demonstrated that, since the error increases with
rainfall intensity, the assumption is not acceptablefor the assessment of design rainfall in
urban-scale applications.

Tipping bucket rain gauges are commonly used in rainfall measurement campaigns. The main
disadvantage of these devices is that they underestimate rainfall volumes at the higher rainfall
intensities, due to the loss of water during the tipping action of the device.

The convective nature of rainfall will increase gauge-interpolation uncertainties as the standard deviation increased.
Specifically, both satellite techniques (TRMM, CHMRPH) underestimate rainfall over higher elevations, especially during the cold season, and their performance is subject to seasonal changes.
