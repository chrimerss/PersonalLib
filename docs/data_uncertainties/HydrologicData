# Worth of data

__[When enough is enough: The worth of monitoring data in aquifer remediation design](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/94WR01972?saml_referrer)__

This is a paper from Steve that he worked to find out where and when to deploy data collection so that both the sampling uncertainty and economic cost are reduced.

Even this was applied in groundwater contamination data, it can be applied to other hydrologic data design such as streamflow, rainfall, and many others.
