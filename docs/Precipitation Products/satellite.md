__Chaoying Huang, J. H., Sheng Chen, Asi Zhang, Zhenqing Liang,Xinhua Tong ,Liusi Xiao, Chao Min,Zengxin Zhang (2019). "How Well Can IMERG Products Capture Typhoon Extreme Precipitation Events over Southern China? ." Remote Sensing 11(70): 1-22.__

Author in detail described difference between early product and final product (uncalibrated). He compared early product and final product
 with refered to gauge ground truth data for six extremely heavy precipitation events. The results indicated that IMERG final product
 can capture the spatial partterns of storm. with gauge calibrated is underestimated comapred to without gauge calibration over rainfall core.
