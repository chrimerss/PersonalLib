Author analyzed oceanic precipitation at zonal scales for products: GPCP (global precipitation climatology project), merged CloudSat CPR
 and TRMM-PR, CMAP (Climate predicting center Merged Analysis of Precipitation) at 80N to 80S. The results shown that the new merged 
 TRMM/CloudSat estimates rain rate is 2.94 mm/day 9% higher than CMAP, 4% higher than GPCP,

Author summarized following general partterns: (a) increased precipitation in high latitudes (NH); (b) reductions in precipitation in China, Australia and the Small Island Staates in the Pacific; (c) equatorial regions becone more variable, i.e. increased variance.

Annual zonally averaged precipitation increased by between 7% and 12% for the zones 30N to 85N and by about 2%between 0S and 55S.

The random errors contained in a finite set E of precipitation estimates result from both finite sampling and measurement–algorithm effects. The expected root-mean-square random error associated with the estimated average precipitation in E is shown to be $\sigma_r = r̄{(H − p)/pNI}^(1/2)$, where r̄ is the space–time-average precipitation estimate over E, H is a function of the shape of the probability distribution of precipitation (the nondimensional second moment), p is the frequency of nonzero precipitation in E, and NI is the number of independent samples in E. All of these quantities are variables of the space–time-average dataset. In practice H is nearly constant and close to the value 1.5 over most of the globe. An approximate form of $σ_r$ is derived that accommodates the limitations of typical monthly datasets, then it is applied to the microwave, infrared, and gauge precipitation monthly datasets from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project. As an aid to visualizing differences in $σ_r$ for various datasets, a “quality index” is introduced. Calibration in a few locations with dense gauge networks reveals that the approximate form is a reasonable first step in estimating $σ_r$.

Author compared IMERG late product and TRPA product with one year dataset for CONUS, with MRMS radar data as reference. He decomposed error sources into successful detection, false detection, miss rain and explored seasonality of the differences. As the results suggests, IMERG has improved performance mainy due to: improved IR detection (PERSIANN-CCS), smoother interpolation (CMORPH-KF). Most of the error accumulates in the region where convective precipitation dominates.
