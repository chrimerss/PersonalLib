__[Association between extreme rainfall and acute respiratory infection among children under-5 years in sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data, 2006–2020](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/13/4/e071874.full.pdf)__

In this paper, the authors used CHIRPS as an environmental variable and Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) cross-sectional data to investigate the acute respiratory infection with rainfall. However, no significant relation between the two was found except for Nigeria. The authors speculate that "Major flooding due to extreme rainfall reported across Nigeria in August 2018 resulted in large-scale population displacement. Indeed, the period of this event overlapped with the period from which DHS data in Nigeria were obtained. Flooding can increase respiratory fungal or polymicrobial infections by increasing inhalational exposure to these microorganisms under wet and humid conditions. 5 In some cases, increased transmission of ARI can occur from overcrowding in shelters after disasters"
