# Water and energy limits for basin characteristics

Famous Budyko curve which separates zones with energy limits and water limites

__[Macroscale water fluxes 2. Water and energy supply control of their interannual variability](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001WR000760)__

The authors investigated the long-term explaination of monthly anomaly of precipitation, runoff (not lagged to distinguish runoff and discharge), and net radiation.

1. Runoff anomalies of humid basins should be independent of the seasonal distribution of the precipitation anomaly. (In humid regions, 70%-80% of runoff variance is explained by annual precipitation)
2. the increase in runoff caused by a positive precipitation anomaly is amplified by an accompanying decrease in surface net radiation, possibly induced by increased cloud cover

__[The potential to reduce uncertainty in regional runoff projections from climate models (Nature Climate Change)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0639-x)__

It tells the ESM runoff is highly biased and need cautions when directly using it for regional studies.

1. uncertainty in projected runoff is even larger than uncertainty in precipitation in many regions 
2. It is unclear why diverse biases across ESM.
