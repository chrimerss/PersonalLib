__[Macroscale water fluxes 2. Water and energy supply control of their interannual variability](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001WR000760)__

The authors investigated the long-term explaination of monthly anomaly of precipitation, runoff (not lagged to distinguish runoff and discharge), and net radiation.

1. Runoff anomalies of humid basins should be independent of the seasonal distribution of the precipitation anomaly. (In humid regions, 70%-80% of runoff variance is explained by annual precipitation)
2. the increase in runoff caused by a positive precipitation anomaly is amplified by an accompanying decrease in surface net radiation, possibly induced by increased cloud cover
