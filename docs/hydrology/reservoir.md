Model: Tree-based models
Inputs:

1. Water storage
2. hydrologic data (inflow, precipitation, snow depth)
3. wet/dry indices
4. River indices to consider inflow
5. water allocation by rules
6. Seasonality

They impose reservoir operating rule to a large-scale model framework VIC to become VICRes model. Soil parameters are calibrated based on a optimization framework.

In this work, they compared with and without reservoir simulation in Mekong River Basin. In fact, there are not many discrepancies between with or without reservoir in terms of daily discharge simulation. However, such differences are amplified when extrapolating to future condition, where without reservoir showed some artifacts.
