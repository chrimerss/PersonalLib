__Zhou, Z., J. A. Smith, L. Yang, M. L. Baeck, M. Chaney, M.-C. Ten Veldhuis, H. Deng, and S. Liu (2017), The complexities of urban flood response: Flood frequency analyses for the Charlotte metropolitan region, Water Resour. Res., 53, 7401–7425, doi:10.1002/2016WR019997.__

In this paper, the authors examined the urban flood characteristics in Charlotte metropolitan area. They addressed basin attributes, stationarity, flood agents, the attributes of antecedent rainfall (wettness) to urban floods, flood response time, runoff ratio to drainage area, correlation of basin-average rainfall to runoff, etc.

The methodlogies in flood analysis could be adopted and some of the conclusions could be cited as well.

__[The impact of urban development on hydrologic regime from catchment to basin scales](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204611002489#bib0175)__

In this paper, the authors evaluated the flood magnitude, frequency, travel times on which the urbanization would impact. They designed experiments determining the spatial variability of impervious areas. Before that, they cautiously divided total impervious area by effective or non-effective impervious area to discriminate the different response by fitting a statistical method.


"This analysis supports the suggestion that the impact of urbanization on flood magnitude decreases as flood recurrence intervals increases as was found by Hollis (1975)."

"watersheds with urban land use located close to the outlet tend to produce smaller peak flows than ones with urban land uses located far from the outlet for the same storm events."

"restricting infiltration rate does not have much impact on high flows during the snow melt season if urban area was located near the basin outlet"

"It demonstrates that antecedent soil moisture could play an important role in assessing the impact of urbanization on flood peaks"

__[by Smith et al. 2001]()__

The authors characterize the response time (V/P) by the flow volume (V) that is calculated as the integral of flows 1 day prior to the peak flow and 2 days after divided by the flow rate (P). 

They investigated the impact due to land cover properties interms of flood magnitude and flood response time; antecedent soil conditions play an important role; the spatial variability of rainfall affects the flood response; storm structure and motion also has marked impact.

__[Beyond imperviousness: the role of antecedent wetness in runoff generation in urbanized catchments](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020WR028060)__

In this article, the authors attempt to examine the interplay of imperviousness and antecedent soil moisture to runoff generation in the US with a large samples.

They considered a range of climate variables and land use variables and morphology variables and geopedology variables. Storm event separation is discussed in this methodology

__[Causal Effect of Impervious Cover on Annual Flood Magnitude for the United States](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL086480)__

In this work, authors adopts causual inference on flood magnitude changes due to the increase in imperviousness. They concluded that one percent increase in impervious basin cover causes a 3.3% increase in annual flood magnitude in the US.

They summarized main three approaches to study on this topic:

1) Case study focusing on temporal variations.  
2) paired catchment with contrast experiment variable.  
3) Model simulations.  

# Climate Change

__[Continental‑scale convection‑permitting modeling of the current and future climate of North America](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3327-9)__

Physical downscaling of global climate model with convection-permitting feature, which can be used as input to investigate the impact of climate change on fine-scale hydrologic responses.

__[Changes in Future Flash Flood–Producing Storms in the United States](https://journals.ametsoc.org/jhm/article/21/10/2221/354228/Changes-in-Future-Flash-Flood-Producing-Storms-in)__

The authors adopted datasets from Dr. Liu for 13-year convective-permitting model and coupled with Noah-MP community model to investigate the flood (i.e., flash flood) response due to a warming climate. They compared CRTL and PWG precipitation against NCEP stage IV dataset using the SSMI index to investigate the structural similarity. But not much traditional quantification has been done. Without any doubts, climate change changes the frequency of flash flood and rainfall intensity. 7.5%/K increase in hourly max. rain rates is observed, but medium rain rates are on par with Clausius-Clapeyron theory.

__[Using machine learning models, remote sensing, and GIS to investigate the effects of changing climates and land uses on flood probability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169420311240)__

In this article, the authors seek to investigate flood risks based on a host of environmental variables, including hydrometrological, topographic, and geological factors. Climate change is factored based on statistical downscaling from long series of gauge data for the change of precipitation, and ANN based methods take account the landuse changes. It is insightful to consider the varibles that could affect flood risks.

__[Comparing Flood Projection Approaches Across Hydro-Climatologically Diverse United States River Basins]()__

In this article, the authors pointed out three approaches to investigate the climate change impact on flooding. (1) Assuming stationarity, (2) hydrologic simulation under general circulation models, and (3) informed-parameter (e.g., time or trend analysis, climate indices, infrastructure development indices, land use indices.They also reviewed lots of literatures and found their limitations.

They specifically look at several questions: (1) how does out-of-sample bias compare between stationary assumption and other approaches, (2) can the direction of change at a gage be projected?, (3) can regional change be projected?, and (4) how much additional bias is introduced when GCM outputs are used to force the climate-based approaches.

In methodology, they first regionalize US basins with self-organising approach, and measured by sihouette width and physical meaning. Then they compared stationarity, climate-informed, precipitation-informed, and hydrologic simulation under the context of Bayesion inference. To conclude, they found precipitation and hydrologic simulation are statstically significant to reveal the flood projection. 

__[Global flood risk under climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1911)__

This paper published in Nature climate change is one of the highly reputed articles that studied flood intensity/frequency changes under a warming climate. It classifies major global river basins and finds a heterogenous feature for future flood response as below. They also simulated number of impacted and exposed people in a future scenario.

__[Future projections of flood dynamics in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720341188#bb0260)__

In this paper, the authors collectively evaluated the change of flood dynamics under the impact of climate change, hydropower regulation, sea-level rise, sustainable development, and floodplain restoration. They not only quantitatively assessed flood hazards (inundation extent, depth, and duration), but also focused on impacts, specifically on rice damages.
