# Weather/Climate - Hydrologic model coupling

__[A review of fully coupled atmosphere-hydrology simulations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11442-019-1610-5)__

in this paper, the authors analyzed publications regarding atmosperic model and hydrologic model interaction to reflect the challenges as well as opportunities for present-day model coupling strategies. They mentioned some points:

1. Two-way coupling processes
2. Scale dependence
3. improvement of model parameters and uncertainties
4. parameter transfer and regionalization
5. hyper-resolution simulation.
