# Weather/Climate - Hydrologic model coupling

__[A review of fully coupled atmosphere-hydrology simulations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11442-019-1610-5)__

in this paper, the authors analyzed publications regarding atmosperic model and hydrologic model interaction to reflect the challenges as well as opportunities for present-day model coupling strategies. They mentioned some points:

1. Two-way coupling processes
2. Scale dependence
3. improvement of model parameters and uncertainties
4. parameter transfer and regionalization
5. hyper-resolution simulation.

# Land-Atmosphere coupling

## Soil moisture reshape/reintensify storms

__[Impacts of Soil Moisture on the Numerical Simulation of a Post-Landfall Storm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13351-019-8002-8)__

The authors suggested the increased soil moisture with SLAB scheme before stormâ€™s landfall tends to produce a weaker storm after landfall and has negative impacts on storm track simulation, because wetter soils tend to cool down ambient environment and thus resulting in a less conducive condition for storm maintanance.

SOM analysis showed that dry states are more likely to occur during monsoon season compared to wet states; however, the probability of genesis of MLPS during a wet-state day is about four times higher compared to a dry state day. These maps showed that in general, the mean inland penetration of wet-state MDs is longer than the MDs that form during dry state.

warmer, wetter (cooler, drier) land surface can intensify (weaken) the landfalling MDs over the Indian monsoon region

They used reanalysis data to investigate the TCMI and non-TCMI storms associated with 2-week antecedent environments. It was found that TCMI storms present greater latent heat than non-TCMI storms. The ET 24-hour to storm trajectory is also much greater for TCMI.
