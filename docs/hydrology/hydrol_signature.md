__[A review of hydrologic signatures and their applications](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/wat2.1499)__

In this paper, the authors reviewed the basic concepts of hydrologic signatures and its implications/applications.

1. Eco-hydrology, environmental flows, and hydrologic alteration

    1.1 Evironmental flows to preserve instream habitat

    1.2 Detecting hydrologic change

2. Watershed process

    2.1 Similarity between watersheds

3. Hydrologic modeling

    3.1 Calibration

    3.2 Evaluation of model structure and parameters

    3.3 Signature regionalization for predictions in ungauged basins

4. Methods in using hydrologic signatures

    4.1 choosing signatures

    4.2 scaling

__[A Ranking of Hydrological Signatures Based on Their Predictability in Space](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018WR022606)__

An investigation of predictability of hydrologic signatures are conducted using a data-driven approach (random forest) and a hydrologic simulation (SNOW-17+SAC).

1. We found that climatic attributes are by far the most influential predictors for signatures that can be well predicted based on catchment attributes
2. We found that spatial smoothness is a simple yet powerful way to gain insights into the drivers of hydrological signatures. Scores are pool in places where there exists an abrupt change in space

__[Large Scale Evaluation of Relationships Between Hydrologic Signatures and Processes WRR](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021WR031751)__

The authors used worldwide CZO (Critical Zone Observation) to map hydrologic signature to present dominant hydrologic processes within each watershed.
