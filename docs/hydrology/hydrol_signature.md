__[A review of hydrologic signatures and their applications](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/wat2.1499)__

In this paper, the authors reviewed the basic concepts of hydrologic signatures and its implications/applications.

1. Eco-hydrology, environmental flows, and hydrologic alteration

    1.1 Evironmental flows to preserve instream habitat

    1.2 Detecting hydrologic change

2. Watershed process

    2.1 Similarity between watersheds

3. Hydrologic modeling

    3.1 Calibration

    3.2 Evaluation of model structure and parameters

    3.3 Signature regionalization for predictions in ungauged basins

4. Methods in using hydrologic signatures

    4.1 choosing signatures

    4.2 scaling

    4.3 uncertainties
