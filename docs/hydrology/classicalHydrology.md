# Rainfall-runoff coefficient

**Miao, C., Zheng, H., Jiao, J., Feng, X., Duan, Q., & Mpofu, E. (2020).
The changing relationship between rainfall and surface runoff on the Loess Plateau, China. Journal of Geophysical Research:
Atmospheres, 125, e2019JD032053. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032053**

In this article, authors examined the rainfall-runoff generation, particularly the coefficient changes over two periods: 1971-1987,
and 2008-2016; This is a decent article to look or review possible attributes of the changing runoff in this specific region (i.e.,
human activity, vegetation, climatology etc.)

One adoptable methodology in this study is to determine the critical point for thresholding runoff throughout Pettitt test.

Main findings:
1. The runoff coefficient decreased greatly in Loess Plateau;
2. The precipitation threshold became greater on the middle regions of the plateau during P2.

# Conceptual planetary hydrology

__Gleeson, T., Wang‐Erlandsson, L., Porkka, M., Zipper, S. C., Jaramillo, F., Gerten, D., et al ( 2020). Illuminating water cycle modifications and Earth system resilience in the Anthropocene. Water Resources Research, 56, e2019WR024957. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR024957__

In this big paper, the authors proposed a framework to address the scientific problems: How to determine the tipping point of changes resulting in a irreversiable situation; in other words, what is the maximum changes that breaks the earth system resilience.

Even though this is a conceptual paper, it really motivates researchers to dive into and look for answers to benefit our human society.

# Coupled hydrologic/hydraulic modeling for flood innudation

__A high resolution coupled hydrologic–hydraulic model (HiResFlood-UCI) for flash flood modeling__

UCI group developed the coupling framework of SAC-based hydrologic model and BreZo-based hydraulic model. The advantage of coupling these two can improve the streamflow prediction, and also provide the flood depth and velocity which is crucial to categorize the flood.
