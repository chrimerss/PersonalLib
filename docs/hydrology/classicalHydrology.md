# Rainfall-runoff coefficient

**Miao, C., Zheng, H., Jiao, J., Feng, X., Duan, Q., & Mpofu, E. (2020).
The changing relationship between rainfall and surface runoff on the Loess Plateau, China. Journal of Geophysical Research:
Atmospheres, 125, e2019JD032053. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032053**

In this article, authors examined the rainfall-runoff generation, particularly the coefficient changes over two periods: 1971-1987,
and 2008-2016; This is a decent article to look or review possible attributes of the changing runoff in this specific region (i.e.,
human activity, vegetation, climatology etc.)

One adoptable methodology in this study is to determine the critical point for thresholding runoff throughout Pettitt test.

Main findings:
1. The runoff coefficient decreased greatly in Loess Plateau;
2. The precipitation threshold became greater on the middle regions of the plateau during P2.
