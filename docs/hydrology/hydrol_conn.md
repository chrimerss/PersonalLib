A set of definitions for hydrologic connectivity:

1. Pringle (2010) broadly defined hydrologic connectivity from the perspective of aquatic ecology as the transport capacity of water-based substances, energy, and life forms in water cycle elements.
2. Herron and Wilson (2001) stated that hydrologic connectivity mainly refers to the efficiency of runoff movement through a basin.

Hydrologic connectivity herein is defined quantitatively as the inversed in-channel water height difference between two adjacent stations.

Stream connectivity is defined using the Graph Theory which considers network as nodes and edges, and the adjancency matrix is constructed to compute a weighted score.

They collected three years of stream network data, in conjuction with hydrologic model MIKE SHE, to reveal the yearly changes in connectivity and thus water conveyance. They illustrated that earlier years have better flood delivery.
