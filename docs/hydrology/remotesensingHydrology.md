A comprehensive review of how remote sensing is applied in aid of hydrology.

# Global hydrologic model

## WaterGAP




# Fresh Water availability

__Rodell, M., Famiglietti, J.S., Wiese, D.N. et al. Emerging trends in global freshwater availability. Nature 557, 651–659 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0123-1__

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

In this article, authors addressed the global map of changes in fresh water availability with satellite observations and also climate models for projection. Very detailed global-regional analysis across the all continents. The impact of elevated precipitation, human-induced irrigation(mining), climate change, glacier depletion, and so on. 

# Calibration

__[Calibrating a hydrological model in a regional river of the Qinghai–Tibet plateau using river water width determined from high spatial resolution satellite images.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718302414?via%3Dihub)__

This paper introduces the first attempt to calibrate a hydrologic model based on river width data derived from commercial satellites. Likewise, this approach is highly suitable in hydrodynamic models because we can estimate river width at given cross-sections.
