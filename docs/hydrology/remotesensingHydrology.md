A comprehensive review of how remote sensing is applied in aid of hydrology for ungauged basins.

__[Recent changes to Arctic river discharge Nature Comm.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27228-1)__

The authors examine the changes in Arctive river discharge from three aspects: 1. trend analysis, 2. inttermetency, and 3. timing of freshet

In doing so, they extracted Landsat-derived discharge data using river width as proxy. Then, they assimilate these data to two popular global large dataset.

# CYGNSS

A nice blog introducing what CYGNSS can do in Atmospheric Science or Hydrology:https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/fromthefield/2021/12/15/five-years-and-counting-happy-birthday-to-the-cygnss-octuplets/

1. Hurricane tracks
2. River outflow to ocean
3. Flood inundation extent
4. Soil moisture

__[First attempt of global-scale assimilation of subdaily scale soil moisture estimates from CYGNSS and SMAP into a land surface model](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0ddf)__

The authors find five soil moisture products (i.e., four from satellite and one from land surface model) to analyze their uncertainties and limitations using Triple Collocation. They also fused satellite products into land surface models to improve the accuracy. They can attribute the pixels gained greatest improvement to each satellite soil moisture product.
