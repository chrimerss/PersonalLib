__[Recent changes to Arctic river discharge Nature Comm.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27228-1)__

The authors examine the changes in Arctive river discharge from three aspects: 1. trend analysis, 2. inttermetency, and 3. timing of freshet

In doing so, they extracted Landsat-derived discharge data using river width as proxy. Then, they assimilate these data to two popular global large dataset.
