# Vector-based runoff routing

## MizuRoute

__[A Vector-Based River Routing Model for Earth System Models: Parallelization and Global Applications](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020MS002434)__

This paper presents a global implementation of MizuRoute modeling, coupled with Earth System Models. They specifically investigated the impact of parallelization on runoff simulations.
