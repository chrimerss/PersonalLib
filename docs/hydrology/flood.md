__L. Landuyt, A. Van Wesemael, G. J. -. Schumann, R. Hostache, N. E. C. Verhoest and F. M. B. Van Coillie, "Flood Mapping Based on Synthetic Aperture Radar: An Assessment of Established Approaches," in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 57, no. 2, pp. 722-739, Feb. 2019, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2018.2860054.__

In this paper, the authors reviewed most commonly used techniques to derive flood extent from Sentinental missions and compared with real applications. They found the stable performance of active countour method in the flood monitoring.

In this paper, the authors proposed a way to map the flood extent with respect to bare soils and urban areas. For bare soil flooding, the adaptive thresholds are applied to mask flooded regions; for urban areas with building, multi-temporal images are acquired to compute the cross-correlation, Temporal Average Intensity, Temporal Average Coherence, and Local Incidence Angle.

They also showcased this methodology to Harvey events in 2017, demonstrated the ability to map the floodplains.
