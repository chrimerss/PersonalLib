Van Coillie, "Flood Mapping Based on Synthetic Aperture Radar: An Assessment of Established Approaches," in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 57, no. 2, pp. 722-739, Feb. 2019, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2018.2860054.__

In this paper, the authors reviewed most commonly used techniques to derive flood extent from Sentinental missions and compared with real applications. They found the stable performance of active countour method in the flood monitoring.
