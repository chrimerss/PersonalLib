# Global Flood Analysis

__[Global modeling of seasonal mortality rates from river floods](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020EF001541)__

In this paper published in Earth's Future, the authors specifically dissect the seasonal response of the global flood events (including the peak timing, peak distribution, flood impact, mortality rate) with the aid of global hydrological model LISFLOOD (GloFAS-Reanalysis dataset v3.0: https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/id-00288)

From the analysis, they not only represent major watersheds in the globe for the pure flood generation, but also sheding lights on political boundaries (i.e. countries) for flood assessment since measures have been taken differently with countries.

It is claimed as the first paper to study on global seasonal flood analysis.

__[Sampson, C. C., A. M. Smith, P. D. Bates, J. C. Neal, L. Alfieri, and J. E. Freer (2015), A high-resolution global flood hazard model, Water Resour. Res., 51, 7358–7381, doi:10.1002/2015WR016954.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015WR016954)__

In this paper, the authors presented six challenges for global flood risk mapping and came with their solutions:

1. reliable terrain data

2. extreme flow generation either by hydrologic model or regional flood frequency analysis

3. global river networks

They approached the river width by using web-survey, and the river depth is estimated based on 1 or 2 year return period discharge as bankfull discharge. With bankful discharge, channel width, and slope, the channel depth could be approached by manning's equation.

4. Flood defenses

This is more challenging than the other because the structure is way smaller than the modelling grid-cell size

5. Computational Hydraulic Engine

"A novel simplified implementation of shallow water equations yielded an glgorithm for which the minimum stable time step scales linearly with decreasing grid size, rather than quadratically as had been the case with previous diffusion wave formulations"

"The study determined that inclusion of both the channel network and floodplain was essential, and that
inclusion of the smaller subgrid channels on the floodplain yielded significantly increased simulation accuracy in terms of water level, wave propagation speed, and inundation extent"

6. Automation Framework

__[Global Reconstruction of Naturalized River Flows at 2.94 Million Reaches](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019WR025287)__

A realisation of 35-yr global stream discharge with VIC land surface model and RAPID vector routing scheme. Over 2 million reaches are simulated globally.

For the LSM, they used the VIC model by Liang et al., calibrated based on global streamflow characteristics (generated by Beck et al., 2015).

They used a sparse PDF matching to overcome model calibration or bias correction errors for postprocessing.

__[Global Maps of Streamflow Characteristics Based on Observations from Several Thousand Catchments](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/16/4/jhm-d-14-0155_1.xml)__

Analysis of global streamflow data, based on flow characteristics.


__[Precipitation and floodiness](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL066779)__

In this paper, the authors factored a few terms to describe the relationship between flood and precipitation at monthly scales. They investigated floodiness (occurence above certain threshold), duration floodiness, max discharge within a 30 year time span. 

1. precipitation and discharge appear to be relatively well correlated; however, it is not correlated as good as discharge.
2. They disencouraged approaches that simply use precipitation as proxy to interpret floods.

# Regional Flood analysis

__[Combined modelling of US fluvial, pluvial and coastal flood hazard under current and future climates](https://www.essoar.org/pdfjs/10.1002/essoar.10504362.1)__

In this paper, the authors updated the current US continental flood hazard maps with assigned frequency under different scenarios (historical, present, and projection). They highlighted the changes in hydrography data, surface water profile, extreme event magnitudes, downscaling using hi-res. terrain data, and incorporated local interventions.

They detailed how the boundary conditions are derived for the consideration of fluvial (IDF forced hydrologic simulation) and coastal flooding (tide gauge data), while for pluvial flooding, they simply uses rain-on-grid simulations at each 30 m grid. 

They indicate the ensemble prediction is important to better quantify the uncertainties and more model validation efforts are needed.

__[Implications of Using Global Digital Elevation Models for Flood Risk Analysis in Cities](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020WR028241)__

In this paper, the authors compared six globbaly available DEM data, and assessed how the DEM coupld affect urban flood forecast. They found OS Terrain 50 has the best statistics when validated against high water marks and flood extent derived from photos, videos.

They finally discussed that the outlet water level data in water channles does not nessarily need to be accurate in impact studies if peak floodplain extent is accurate enough.

__[How probable is widespread flooding in the United States?](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020WR028096)__

In this paper, the authors used a stochastic streamflow generator built upon 38 years USGS streamflow data conditioned on main 18 catchments to investigate the spatial distribution of flood events in dependence of flood susceptibility. 

They found a strong dependence of flood susceptibility and seasonality in parts of the US, especially western US. Some catchments governed by intermittent streamflow however exhibits less seasonality. Catchments with snowmelting dominant streamflow generation has high susceptibility in spring and winter.

__[Quantifying the importance of spatial resolution and other factors through global sensitivity analysis of a flood inundation model](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR018198)__

In this paper, the authors firstly evaluate the model sensitivity with respect to parameters, inflow and topography in terms of flood dynamics. They not only simulated based on bulk flow, but also spatiotemporal variation of flood dynamics. It is worth trying to conduct similar research for CREST-iMAP model parameters or probabilistic QPEs.

The authors constructed US flood database based on gauge data and precipitation data to separate baseflow from flood events.




# FLood seasonality

__[Gabriele Villarini](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=KlCa6esAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)__

__[On the seasonality of flooding across the continental United States](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170815002687)__

In this paper, author comprehensively discussed US flood seasonality from meteorological point of view as well as anthropogenic effects such as urbanization and flow regulation. But he claims climatology plays a main role, and urbanisation does not contribute much to the flood seasonality shifts.

__[The changing nature of flooding across the central United States](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2516)__

In this paper, the authors investigated the flood changes (i.e., flood magnitude and flood frequency) with respect to rainfall changes in the Central US. They attribute most of the flood changes to extreme rainfall changes.

__[Mixture Distributions and the Hydroclimatology of Extreme Rainfall and Flooding in the Eastern United States](https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JHM1242.1)__

Spatial heterogeneities in flood peak distributions due to orographic precipitation mechanisms in mountainous terrain, coastal circulations near land–ocean boundaries, and urbanization impacts on regional climate are central features of flood peak distributions for the eastern United States, and for many other settings around the world. Orographic mechanisms in the eastern United States associated with heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, winter–spring extratropical systems, and warm-season thunderstorms are diverse and in many settings poorly understood.

Winter–spring extratropical systems account for a large fraction of eastern U.S. flood peaks, especially in the northeastern and southeastern United States (Fig. 1b). We use the frequency of March–April flood peaks as a surrogate for winter–spring extratropical flood peaks. A combination of snowmelt and rain on snow determines the local maximum in flood peak occurrence in the northeastern United States (Fig. 1b), where March–April peaks account for up to 60% of annual peaks. Organized thunderstorm systems embedded in winter–spring extratropical systems, often associated with severe weather, are important flood agents in the southeastern United States (Fig. 1b). March–April peaks account for more than 50% of annual flood peaks in south Georgia, north Florida, and southeastern Alabama (Fig. 1b).

Warm-season thunderstorm systems are also important flood agents in urban watersheds along the urban megalopolis of the eastern United States

__[Dominant flood generating mechanisms across the United States](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL068070)__

In this paper, authors proposed four hypothesis to investigate the dominant flood-generating process in the US. They isolated overall processes into extreme rainfall-caused, rainfall-caused, excess-rainfall caused, snow-melt caused. Eventually they clustered US regions with respective flood processes.

__[The Relative Importance of Different Flood-Generating Mechanisms Across Europe](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019WR024841)__

Three major flood driving mechanisms are identified:

1. Extreme precipitation: In extreme precipitation floods, the maximum annual flow results from the largest precipitation event of that year. 
2. Soil Moisture excess: In soil moisture excess floods, the maximum annual flow is caused by the largest daily soil moisture excess event. It is defined as the daily precipitation amount minus the available soil moisture storage capacity.
3. Snowmelt: in snowmelt floods, the maximum annual flow is caused by the largest daily snowmelt or rain-on-snow event of the year.

They also quantified flood seasonality with circular method.

</p>

A striking feature is that in Euro, flood dependence on extreme precipitation is weak while it is more or less based off snowmelt and soil moisture excess (most important).

</p>

The disconnect between precipitation extremes and flooding helps to contextualize flood trends. For example, observations indicate that annual maximum daily precipitation is increasing (Westra et al., 2013), but such a persistent increase is not found in observed annual maximum floods in Europe (Hall et al., 2014). Similarly, model simulations of European river floods at 1.5, 2, and 3 °C global warming indicate a very weak correlation between changes in precipitation extremes and changes in flood magnitudes (Thober et al., 2018). These observations are not very surprising when we consider that most annual peak floods are in fact not caused by annual peak precipitation. Our results point to the processes (snowmelt and soil moisture excess) that likely better explain flood trends in Europe (Blöschl et al., 2017).

# Flood flashiness

__[Mapping Flash Flood Severity in the United States](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/18/2/jhm-d-16-0082_1.xml)__

The authors introduced the flashiness index using US-wide gauges. They analyzed the factors (e.g., seasonality, flow accumulation, etc.) associated with flashiness.

# Spatial dependence of flood

__[Spatial Dependence of Floods Shaped by Spatiotemporal Variations in Meteorological and Land-Surface Processes (GRL)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL088000)__

1. Flood identification

  - POT: flow rate exceeding 25th percentile of 30-year annual maxima and minimum 10 days time lag between events.
  - compile events with all catchments with binary matrix.
  - identify regional flood that only affect single catchment.

2. Spatial pattern of flood occurence

flood connectedness: co-experience of flood events.
F-madogram measures spatial dependence as a function of distance between a pair of stations.

3. Pair with hydrometeorologic drivers

__[Growing Spatial Scales of Synchronous River Flooding in Europe (GRL)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL081883)__

They first introduce the flood synchrony scale, defined as the maximum radius around an individual river gauge within which at least half of the other river gauges also record flooding almost simultaneously.

__[Joint Trends in Flood Magnitudes and Spatial Extents Across Europe (GRL)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL087464)__

Flood Synchrony scale measure: __the maximum distance from a  station within which at least 50% of the stations have the annual maximum flood discharge at the same time as the reference station__. A 7-day delay is allowed to account for travel time in EU weather and routing system.

They classified flood by its generating mechanisms: 1) convective rainfall; 2) snowfall; 3) rain-on-snow; 4) soil excess rainfall.

An increase/decrease in flood synchrony is shown:
