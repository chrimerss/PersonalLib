# Multi-Source Flood database

[Spatiotemporal analysis of heavy rain-induced flood occurrences in Germany using a novel event database approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421000329?dgcid=rss_sd_all&utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound)
The author detailed general processes to build a flood database and what are the caveats. In addition to regular event identification attributes
they assigned other metrics to explore flood events associated with residents.

1. Hot and cold spots of floods

They used a Moran's Index value to identify the clustering feature of local community exposed to floods.

2. Event binning

They aggregate density of events with a size of 100 km^2 to compare the flood density.
