[__Closing the water cycle from observations across scales: Where do we stand?__](https://journals.ametsoc.org/configurable/content/journals$002fbams$002faop$002fBAMS-D-19-0316.1$002fBAMS-D-19-0316.1.xml?tab_body=pdf)

A hierarchical review paper, published by BAMS, discusses available data sources in hydrologic components on Earth. They separate those components into states (i.e., fresh water storage, atmospheric moisture, soil moisture, groundwater, permafrost and ground ice, snow, glaciers, ice sheets, water in biomass) and fluxes (e.g., evaporation, precipitation, river discharge, groundwater recharge, ice sheet turnover, anthropogenic water useage, 

"On a yearly basis, only about 0.008% of the water available on Earth is cycled. In other words, it takes about 12,500 years until all water molecules have completed a full ocean-atmosphere-land-ocean cycle"


"Although the latest generation of reanalysis products, e.g., MERRA-2 or ERA5, show improvements over their predecenssors, trends in many of their water cycle components remain uncertain. Besides, global scale changes are particularly difficult to capture in renalaysis since the moisture and energy balance are not constrained."
