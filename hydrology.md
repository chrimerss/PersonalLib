[__Knowledge Gaps in GB’s Perceptual Model__](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.14288)

A review paper on perceptual models: reflection on roadmaps and envisions on future development. Although it focuses on GB, the general knowledge can be adopted elsewhere.

[__Closing the water cycle from observations across scales: Where do we stand?__](https://journals.ametsoc.org/configurable/content/journals$002fbams$002faop$002fBAMS-D-19-0316.1$002fBAMS-D-19-0316.1.xml?tab_body=pdf)

A hierarchical review paper, published by BAMS, discusses available data sources in hydrologic components on Earth. They separate those components into states (i.e., fresh water storage, atmospheric moisture, soil moisture, groundwater, permafrost and ground ice, snow, glaciers, ice sheets, water in biomass) and fluxes (e.g., evaporation, precipitation, river discharge, groundwater recharge, ice sheet turnover, anthropogenic water useage, 

"On a yearly basis, only about 0.008% of the water available on Earth is cycled. In other words, it takes about 12,500 years until all water molecules have completed a full ocean-atmosphere-land-ocean cycle"


"Although the latest generation of reanalysis products, e.g., MERRA-2 or ERA5, show improvements over their predecenssors, trends in many of their water cycle components remain uncertain. Besides, global scale changes are particularly difficult to capture in renalaysis since the moisture and energy balance are not constrained."

__[Human domination of the global water cycle absent from depictions and perceptions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0374-y)__

The authors reviewed around 300 open-source water cycle diagrams and made complete revisit of the perceiption.

[__Should we apply bias correction? HESS__](https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/9/5355/2012/hessd-9-5355-2012.pdf)

According to the recommendation of the Joint Working Group on Forecast Verification Research (JWGFVR), the comparison should be performed between gridded data sets (WWRP 2009-1), with the grid resolution of the models degraded by a factor of 3–4 to take into account numerical filter effects (see e.g. Bauer et al., 2011).

Cases of bias:
1. imperfect physical schemes
2. boundary feedbacks for RCM, which is strongly sensitive to model physics.
3. climate variability (model simulation cannot represent the full length of climate)
4. uncertainty using RCM to drive hydrologic model

__[The terrestrial water cycle in a warming world. Nat. Clim. Chang.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01412-7)__

The authors advocate the use of a simply model to describe complex climate change schcemes, instead of using complex model. The underlying rational is that error/uncertainties propagate from the atmosphere to land surface by admitting more uncertainties in land surface processes. So, if atmospheric component is available, use readily available and less uncertain and less complex variables (simple model) instead of complex indices.

__[Emerging trends in global freshwater availability. Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0123-1)__

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

In this article, authors addressed the global map of changes in fresh water availability with satellite observations and also climate models for projection. Very detailed global-regional analysis across the all continents. The impact of elevated precipitation, human-induced irrigation(mining), climate change, glacier depletion, and so on.
